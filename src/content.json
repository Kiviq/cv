My previous job experiences thought me to be precise and assertive. Not always I've been developer, my previous position in Customer Care thought me how to manage projects and create briefs with clients. \n I've graduated Warsaw School of Applied Linguistics with major in translations, this gave me opportunity to work with passionate people. Also, my experience at Customer Care departments gives me leverage when it comes to business negatitations or making briefs with clients."
